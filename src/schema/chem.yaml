  A data model for managing information about chemical entities, ranging from atoms
  through molecules to complex mixtures.

  Aspects of this have been cribbed from various sources including CHEBI, SIO,

    description: >-
      The carbohydrate structure format used by the Complex Carbohydrate Structure Database (CCSD) originally developed at the University of Georgia. This is a 2D structure where bars and hyphens are used to indicate linkages, and monosaccharides are specified in the following order, separated by hyphens: anomer - configuration symbol - monosaccharide abbreviation.

  linucs representation:
    is_a: carboydrate representation
    description: >-
      A unique linear notation proposed and used by GLYCOSCIENCES.de, with the reducing end specified on the left. Monosaccharides, written according to CarbBank rules, are surrounded by square brackets and anomers, and stereochemistry is specified and separated by hyphens. Glycosidic linkages are also surrounded by hyphens, and carbon numbers of the linkages are separated by the plus sign. Branches are indicated by curly brackets.

  glycominds linearcode representation:
    is_a: carboydrate representation
    description: >-
      A linear notation proposed by GlycoMinds, Ltd., where monosaccharides are indicated by a one- or two-letter code, linkages are indicated by “a” or “b” for anomers and a single number for the carbon number linkage on the reducing end, and branches are indicated by parentheses. This format is the most compact among existing formats, and several databases use a modified form of this format to accommodate additional codes and varying carbohydrate structures (such as ambiguous structures).

  kegg chemical function representation:
    is_a: carboydrate representation
    description: >-
      A multiline format used by the KEGG GLYCAN database and represents glycans as graphs. Monosaccharides are represented as nodes, and glycosidic linkages are represented as edges. Each node is given a unique number, and x- and y- coordinates are specified such that the glycan structure can be drawn on a 2D plane. Edge information uses the node numbers to specify anomeric and carbon number information. Monosaccharide names are specified as text, and no particular rules are specified to represent these names.

  glycoct condensed:
    is_a: carboydrate representation
    description: >-
      This is a multiline format used by GlycomeDB, among others, and uses a graph notation to represent glycans, similar to KCF. Monosaccharides are specified more strictly to be able to map the monosaccharides between different representations. Substituents, such as N-acetyl, are specified as separate nodes from their basetypes and are linked together in the edge section. If newlines are removed, this format can be made linear.

      Holds between C and P if C owl:subClassOf P. Note that in this model, most classes are metaclasses (see 'owl class'), where these metaclasses may represent *groupings* or specific countable elements or species. We provide two different sub-properties of subclass of for two cases: (1) subtype_of, which connects grouping classes (e.g. alkane is_a hydrocarbon; alpha-amino-acid is_a amino-acid), (2) classified_by, which connects a specific element to a grouping class (e.g. methane is_a hydrocarbon; iron is_a metal; serine is_a amino-acid)
